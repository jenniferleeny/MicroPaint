# Details
The user is provided with 3 difficulty levels, and based on the difficulty level they choose, an image will be provided for them to draw/replicate. The user can control the width and the color of their brush using the left-hand tool panel. Once the user is done, he/she can submit their painting and have it graded using our algorithm. The algorithm traverses through the array of pixels and grades based on how close the rgb values of the pixels of the original and the replicated images are.
